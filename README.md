# Multi-User todo app
This app uses React and Express to allow multiple users to edit a todo list. This app demonstates the fundimentals in creating a multiplayer application.

## Some difficulties
The implimentation of this was very difficult and this was mainly due to handling sockets and the way the Express server is configured. I belive there are easier alternatives to this using different Languages/ frameworks such as Python.
